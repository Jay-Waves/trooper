Trooper, currently under development, is a self-use value mutation tool designed to enhance our fuzzer's effectiveness. It operates by receiving seeds (interpreted as byte streams -> uint8 arrays) from an input seed pool and applies subtle modifications to them. I have incorporated a variety of mutation methods into Trooper. The decision-making process for selecting these mutation methods is outsourced to an external fuzz server. In more detail, the fuzzer supplies Trooper with seeds along with a set of 'knobs', which are essentially weightings assigned to the different mutation methods. Trooper then employs these weightings to probabilistically determine the mutation technique to apply, subsequently returning the altered seeds.

It's important to note that Trooper is agnostic to the mechanism of iterating over the knobs; it merely accepts them from the calling process. The fuzzer using Trooper should continuously monitor the behavior of the program under fuzzing test, adjusting the knobs based on this observed behavior.

seed (byte array) and knobs -> trooper -> mutated seeds (mutants)
